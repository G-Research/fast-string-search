# Fast substring search

## Problem statement

* We have 100M lines (strings).
* We have 5K keys (strings).
* For each line, we want to know which specific keys are in that line, if any, as quickly as possible.

The set of lines changes frequently.

## Approaches

* [x] Naive Python regex
* [x] Python regex built from trie
* [x] pyahocorasick
* [x] Rust Aho-Corasick (w/Teddy)
* [x] Hyperscan
* [x] FlashText (pure Python) â€” maybe did it wrong? It's _very_ slow, slower than naive regex
* [x] Rust FlashText (even slower than Python!)
* [ ] RE2
* [ ] Hash set?
* [ ] Ragel

## Approaches with details

### Python regex

Search for "key1|key2|key3|etc.". This is slow.

### Regex constructed from trie

Create a trie, then a regex from that: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42742810/speed-up-millions-of-regex-replacements-in-python-3/42789508#42789508

* Python library: https://github.com/ZhukovAlexander/triegex, seems possibly broken though (there may be others)
* Ended up using the StackOverflow version

### Hash map/set (has additional restrictions)

Assumes lines can be split into words that can map to keys. You can then check each of those words against the hashed set of keys.

### FlashText (has additional restrictions)

Assumes lines can be split into words that can map to keys.

Pure Python implementation: https://github.com/vi3k6i5/flashtext

### Aho-Corasick

Bit like FlashText, only doesn't have the boundary restriction, can do substrings too.

* C + Python implementation: https://pypi.org/project/pyahocorasick/
* Rust implementation (w/SIMD): https://github.com/BurntSushi/aho-corasick

### Hyperscan

Supposedly has algorithm much faster than Aho-Corasick.

### RE2

Google regex library, supposedly quite fast.

### Teddy

Rust library inspired by Hyperscan but focusing only on the use case we care about, rather than general regex.

https://github.com/jneem/teddy

Apparently the Rust implementation of aho-corasick actually includes it built-in, so benchmarking that.

### Ragel

"Ragel compiles executable finite state machines from regular languages."
Basically would involve running a C compiler on the generated state machine!

## Second-pass optimizations, if necessary

Given this will be used with Pandas, bypassing Python functions altogether to iterate over the strings directly would speed things up.
Specifically, the code would iterate over NumPy object arrays; there are also Pandas StringArrays but apparently they're still experimental.
